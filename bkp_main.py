# Publish data to a Thingspeak channel using the MQTT protocol
#
# Micropython implementation using the ESP8266 platform
# Tested using Micropython v1.9.3 (Nov 1, 2017)
#
# Tested using Hardware:
# - Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266
#
# prerequisites:
# - Thingspeak account
# - Thingspeak channel to publish data
# - Thinkspeak Write API Key for the channel
# - Thinkspeak MQTT API Key for the account

# connection uses unsecure TCP (port 1883)
#
# Steps to change to a secure connection (encrypted) using TLS
#   a) change port below to "port=8883

#   NOTE:  TLS uses about 9k bytes of the heap. That is a lot.
